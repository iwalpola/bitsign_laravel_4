What is the blockchain?

The blockchain is a public ledger maintained by a network of computers across the globe, and it is virtually impossible for any single entity to change the records in it, as they would need to compete with the massive processing power of the rest of the network.

What does this mean for your signatures? Once you BitSign a document and we store a record of it in the blockchain, it's tamper-proof and instantly verifiable from anywhere, at any time, even 100 years from now.
